About The Project

My challenge was to build a weather dashboard using a API key to retrieve weather data for cities. The dashboard will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. 



Built With

JavaScript
Moment
Bootstrap
JQuery


Installation

Get a free API Key at [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5)
Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
Enter your API in script.js


Usage
Run the index.html in your browser. You should be able to search one of the following cities: "Berlin", "Paris", "Edinburgh", "Madrid", "Birmingham" or "London" in the input space. this will run the chosen city's weather(temperature, wind and humidity). Also if you click in one of the buttons display in the window you should be able to see the same result.
